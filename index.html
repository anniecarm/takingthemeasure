   	<p class="intro"><!-- Welcome to the anxiety project.<br><br>  -->The data you will see here was collected from students at The New School. 225 students responded to a survey flier posted around every school building. Each responder was faced with different scenarios at The New School and that a college student in New York City would face. They ranked each scenario on a stress scale of 1-10. A 1 means it did not give them anxiety, and a 10 meant it gave them great anxiety to the point of an anxiety or panic attack. <br><br>The responses were separated by those who have anxiety disorders and those without anxiety disorders. 44% of the responders have anxiety disorders. Responses from people with anxiety disorders are yellow. Responses from people without anxiety disorders are blue.<br><br> When you begin you will be given the same scenario and ranking scale. Once you choose your anxiety level for each scenario, the responses from the survey will be revealed so you can see how you compare.</p>
